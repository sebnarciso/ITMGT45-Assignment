        <h1>About Us.</h1>
        <p>My story begins in Tokyo, Japan.  Being raised by parents who were enthusiasts of a universal language called ‘’Esperanto”,<br> we would travel abroad every summer to attend a “World Esperanto Congress” held in different countries. <br> My father was the owner of a manufacturing and trading company, and together with his frequent business trips, <br> they would take me overseas whenever possible – ultimately helping to inspire my love of multiculturalism, design, and architecture.</p>
